# WeBook

WeBook is pronounced Web Book, the concept is you can write a Book, 
it will handle output formats like HTML for a Web Book, PDF,
Movie Scripts, Storyboards, and many more formats.

I am starting from scratch working with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, using .Net, MAUI, C#, and Blazer for cross-platform applications.

# Concept

Currently, MAUI does not support Linux, but I was told it will at some point in time,
so I am building this with that promose in mind,
and to be honus, everyone knows they are working on it, 
and the only reason we do not have it now, 
is because of the Bug Reports,
Linux users are used to two things,
Free, which means they have to file Bug Reports,
and MS knows this, so they want to minimze the number before release.

Linux needs to have a Store like MS, Google, and Apple,
only then will things change for Linux,
Text to Speach will only improve after this happens.

I just started a new Blazer Hybrid Applicatoin that uses .Net and MAUI, 
I will work on the Windows and Android versions only because I do not have a Mac,
but do have plans to get a Mac VPS account,
so I can compile Mac and iOS Applications.

Currenty, I have a Linux VPS where I host the Light Wizzard Videos and Books,
but plan to get a Windows and Mac VPS account, 
so I can have downloadable Application packages for the following Operations Systems (OS).

Current Support:

* Windows
* Android
* Web Application

Future Support:

* Mac (Need VPS account)
* iOS (Need VPS account)
* Web Application

Waiting for Support in Visual Studio for Linux

* Linux
* Raspberry PI
* Web Application

# Functionality

WeBook uses a Text Editor, and a Word Processor,
to allow a user to create a book, 
that can be used to create a Website.

The concept is to create a Project Manager,
you will use it to create Books.

A Book is the standard package,
it has many aspects to it:

* Book
* Screenplay
* Documentary
* Website

It will feature a set of tools that allows you to markup your text,
using HTML features found in all Web Projects,
but really it is a Rich Document type,
and can be a Docx format when export it,
it will have many optoins.

Once I write the App, I can start to use screen shots to describe it,
so I will write this in a way I can later add the images.

This application is cross-platform, so depending on what OS you are running,
will depend on how it looks, so I will try to get screeen shots of every OS it currently supports.

I use a Wizard approch to programing a UI,
this method works well for this application,
the first screen will be the Project Manager,
it will list all your Books,
keep in mind that everything you want to write about,
or document, is a book, for example:

I open up WeBook with the understanding it is just a Word Processor,
that can make PDF files, so you can use it for that one format it can handle,
so a book can be my Cook Book, my Diary, my Life, my Job, my Dogs, my Cats, My Birds, my Cats that eat my Birds, and so on.

WeBook is meant to run on the Web, and Blazer is the way it will do this,
but I need a Windows Server to host it,
as will you, and this App is for you, so it is up to you to get your own Servers.

The Blazer app will run on your local machine, using a Brower that supports WebAssembly.

If you want make a Movie, and I mean a block buster movie, but without going Bankrupt,
you need a tool that is going to enspire you to write this book, or Screenplay.

The way this app stores data an opton, using a Database, or File System, is that optoin, I want make it an option,
to not only pick Database, but pick what type, and its location if that is applicable,
so if you pick SQL Light, you will be asked for a file location, 
same as if you picked File System.

Database support depends on OS:

* SQL Server (Windows)
* My SQL or Forks like MarianDB (Windows, Mac, and Linux once it is supported)
* SQL Light (Local Storage)
* PostGree
* File System (This uses many file formats: txt, md, html, and docx)

The Wizard is part of the app, it can be found under Help, it will help you to create somehthing,
using a series of steps, guiding you through each step.

# Game

This application will have a Game,
the Game is writen using a Game Engine,
the reason for the Game, is to give you another way to run the same Application in a 3D enviroment.

Game Engines I will be using:

* Unreal Engine 5
* Unity
