# WeBook

WeBook is pronounced Web Book, the concept is you can write a Book, 
it will handle output formats like HTML for a Web Book, PDF,
Movie Scripts, Storyboards, and many more formats.

I am starting from scratch working with Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) 2022, using .Net, MAUI, C#, C++, and Blazer for cross-platform applications.

I will use Unreal Engine and Unity to write a Game that will do the same thing the Applicaton does.

# Concept

The main concept is to write a cross-platform Application,
and write it again using a Game Engine,
so you can go all tasks in differnt Enviromnets.

Currently, MAUI does not support Linux, but I was told it will at some point in time,
so I am building this with that promose in mind,
and to be honus, everyone knows they are working on it, 
and the only reason we do not have it now, 
is because of the Bug Reports,
Linux users are used to two things,
Free, which means they have to file Bug Reports,
and MS knows this, so they want to minimze the number before release.

Linux needs to have a Store like MS, Google, and Apple,
only then will things change for Linux,
Text to Speach will only improve after this happens.

I just started a new Blazer Hybrid Applicatoin that uses .Net and MAUI, 
I will work on the Windows and Android versions only because I do not have a Mac,
but do have plans to get a Mac VPS account,
so I can compile Mac and iOS Applications.

Currenty, I have a Linux VPS where I host the Light Wizzard Videos and Books,
but plan to get a Windows and Mac VPS account, 
so I can have downloadable Application packages for the following Operations Systems (OS).

Current Supported OS:

* Windows
* Android
* Web Application

Future Support OS:

* Mac (Need VPS account)
* iOS (Need VPS account)
* Web Application

Waiting for Support in Visual Studio for Linux OS and PI

* Linux
* Raspberry PI
* Web Application

This project will use another one of my GitHub projects called [The Stone Crystal Wizard](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/The-Stone-Crystal-Wizard),
to demo this project, by using the Data from this project, 
so show off this project, 
as such, I will use this Applicatoin to write that story.

# Functionality

WeBook uses a Text Editor, and a Word Processor,
to allow a user to create a book, 
that can be used to create a Website.

The concept is to create a Project Manager,
you will use it to create Books.

A Book is the standard package,
it has many aspects to it:

* Book
* Screenplay
* Stageplay
* Documentary
* Radio
* Podcast
* Website
* Notes
* Instructions
* Speach
* Idea or Concept
* Buisness plan
* Work Project

It will feature a set of tools that allows you to markup your text,
using HTML features found in all Web Projects,
but really it is a Rich Document type,
and can be a Docx format when export it,
it will have many optoins.

Once I write the App, I can start to use screen shots to describe it,
so I will write this in a way I can later add the images.

This application is cross-platform, so depending on what OS you are running,
will depend on how it looks, so I will try to get screeen shots of every OS it currently supports.

I use a Wizard approch to programing a UI,
this method works well for this application,
the first screen will be the Project Manager,
it will list all your Books,
keep in mind that everything you want to write about,
or document, is a book, for example:

I open up WeBook with the understanding it is just a Word Processor,
that can make PDF files, so you can use it for that one format it can handle,
so a book can be my Cook Book, my Diary, my Life, my Job, my Dogs, my Cats, My Birds, my Cats that eat my Birds, and so on.

WeBook is meant to run on the Web, and Blazer is the way it will do this,
but I need a Windows Server to host it,
as will you, and this App is for you, so it is up to you to get your own Servers.

The Blazer app will run on your local machine, using a Brower that supports WebAssembly.

If you want make a Movie, and I mean a block buster movie, but without going Bankrupt,
you need a tool that is going to enspire you to write this book, or Screenplay.

The way this app stores data an opton, using a Database, or File System, is that optoin, I want make it an option,
to not only pick Database, but pick what type, and its location if that is applicable,
so if you pick SQL Light, you will be asked for a file location, 
same as if you picked File System.

Database support depends on OS:

* SQL Server (Windows)
* My SQL or Forks like MarianDB (Windows, Mac, and Linux once it is supported)
* SQL Light (Local Storage)
* PostGree
* File System (This uses many file formats: txt, md, html, and docx)

The Wizard is part of the app, it can be found under Help, it will help you to create somehthing,
using a series of steps, guiding you through each step.

# Features

Some of the main Features are:

* Email
* Chat
* SMS
* Voice Call
* Voice Video Call

Every devices has its own features, for example, a Smartphone has optoins you cannot get on a Desktop,
like acceleration, not to mention SMS is not on most Desktops when I wrote this,
but I do with them in my app, so I will try to make that happen,
but to the best of my abiltity, you might have to link your Smartphone to this app to get those capabilities.

# Game

This application will have a Game,
the Game is writen using a Game Engine,
the reason for the Game, is to give you another way to run the same Application in a 3D enviroment.

Game Engines I will be using:

* Unreal Engine 5
* Unity

The concept of a Game is very simple, I can create an Enviroment for a conference meating,
you have Email to send out envitaions, people can join in many ways,
but everyone must be running the Game,
it can be deployed to many types of Devices, a few are:

* Website
* Local Host
* VR headsets
* Applicaton

The Website gives you a text version of that is going on, and is more benifical for blind users,
Local Host is a way to deploy a Web presentation.

The best option is VR headsets, but all methods require the Applicatoin.

This applicaton is writen for Blind or Sight imparied, as well as Deft or hard of hearing, which describes me,
so I will talk about feature for all realities.

You can move around in VR, look at the Book shelf for all the books you have writen,
and you can fully edit them in the Game, it is meant to do the same things,
but in a Virtual Reality Envirment.

This Game depends on a lot of VS C++ code.

# Book

The Book is just a bunch of pages that you want to organize into something, what that is does not matter,
this book can be a Speach you need to make, or a project you are working on,
and you use it to write down all the things you need to remember.

If you want to write about your life, this is the Application, and you can use the Game or the Application.

To make a Moive we need to start as a Book, or Screenplay.

Depending on your Style, you will pick a book, Screenplay, Stageplay, documentary, idea, concept, project, or other categoies,
these will give you access to a specal set of themes, templates, and Styles,
while you still have access to all of them, and can use them all in one book,
it really comes down to what the styles do, for example, looke at this Scrrenplay:


**INT. DAY**

*_The main actor sits in front of a remote vehicle talking into its camera and explaining why._*

                                     *ACTOR*

Hello, my name is ...

**EXT. THE END**

The way it formats is not the same as a book, so you have to have two files, 
but you want to make it easy and allow you to go both ways,
if you write the above in a Sceenplay, and want it in your book,
just hightlight it, and pick book, and then go into the book,
and place your cursor where it goes, and paste it in, 
same for a book, plus if you edit anything marked as a link,
it update the other documents as well, 
you have the option to set link, or unlinked at any time.

To get Spell and Grammar checking into this app, 
might require some work, so I need it to be compatible with 3rd Party products.

The App and Game, are both ways to do the same thing,
but in a different enverionment,
I have to write the Editor in C++,
I will use Visual Studio or VS, 
and make sure it is cross-platform,
so you get the same expericane no matter what OS you are on.

The above Screenplay format also shows off the fact that every line in a script, 
might be something different, 
for example, INT, or EXT or a few others, 
are indicators as to where this takes place, so it needs to be a different Style,
so you use the Style called "Scence",
and you have a Narrorator Style, and an Actor Style,
so that you can have a style for everything you want to,
and write code to deal with each of these Styles differently.

# Users

The Users are people who will use this Applicaton, either the App or Game,
and are the reason for writing this.

This is a muliple user app, so you can have team of people working on it, even the general public if you make it public,
so it has a feature that allows you to grant permissions to strangers, but you will put them through a hoop to get them permissions,
this loop means they have to verify their email address, and you get their IP, and Email address verified, 
and I will write a functoin that can check to see if the IP is a VPN, but it also can use SMS, or voice ID.

Every time a new user edits a page, another branch is created, you can delete one person for the final, should you not like what the wrote.

This project uses Git, it can be local or on GitHub.
