# WeBook

WeBook is pronounced Web Book, the concept is you can write a Book, 
it will handle output formats like HTML for a Web Book, PDF,
Movie Scripts, Storyboards, and many more formats.

I am starting from scratch working with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, using MAUI and C#, for cross-platform applications.

Currently, MAUI does not support Linux, but I was told it will at some point in time.
