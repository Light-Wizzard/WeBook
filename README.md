# WeBook

WeBook is pronounced Web Book, the concept is you can write a Book, 
it will handle output formats like HTML for a Web Book, PDF,
Movie Scripts, Storyboards, and many more formats.

I am starting from scratch working with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, using .Net, MAUI, C#, and Blazer for cross-platform applications.

Currently, MAUI does not support Linux, but I was told it will at some point in time,
so I am building this with that promose in mind,
and to be honus, everyone knows they are working on it, 
and the only reason we do not have it now, 
is because of the Bug Reports,
Linux users are used to two things,
Free, which means they have to file Bug Reports,
and MS knows this, so they want to minimze the number before release.

Linux needs to have a Store like MS, Google, and Apple,
only then will things change for Linux,
Text to Speach will only improve after this happens.

I just started a new Blazer Hybrid Applicatoin that uses .Net and MAUI, 
I will work on the Windows and Android versions only because I do not have a Mac,
but do have plans to get a Mac VPS account,
so I can compile Mac and iOS Applications.

Currenty, I have a Linux VPS where I host the Light Wizzard Videos and Books,
but plan to get a Windows and Mac VPS account, 
so I can have downloadable Application packages for the following Operations Systems (OS).

Current Support:

* Windows
* Android
* Web Application

Future Support:

* Mac (Need VPS account)
* iOS (Need VPS account)
* Web Application

Waiting for Support in Visual Studio for Linux

* Linux
* Raspberry PI
* Web Application
